            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>Hello there! I am Tyler LeFevre, a programmer on a mission to create meaningful projects.
            With an interest with technology, I have immersed myself in the world of programming, building my skills in various languages and frameworks.</p>
            <h3>What I Do:</h3>
            <p>I specialize in C++, C# and Python, and I am learning Swift, and I am eager to learn and adapt to new challenges. </p>
            <h3>My Journey:</h3>
            <p>My journey in the realm of programming began when I was in high school and decided to take my first programming class.
                 I instantlly fell in love with programming, and ever since I have been building all sorts of interesting projects. I am now in college majoring in computer science. I have had the opportunity to work on different projects that have enhanced my problem-solving abilities and creativity.
                 I am always trying new things and looking to build my skills as a programmer.</p>

            <h3>Realm of the Undead</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a fun and endless 2D top-down zombie game using HTML/CSS/JS, where you face rounds of zombies that keep getting stronger.</li>
                <li>Implemented a custom variant of A* for zombie pathfinding, designed to be as efficient as possible while minimizing player tracking latency.</li>
                <li>Designed a custom map editor with quality-of-life features to simplify building maps, along with a custom map loading system to minimize load times and memory usage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My ToDo</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented an iOS app using SwiftUI to provide a simple and effective task management system, with features such as task prioritization.</li>
                <li>Incorporated SwiftData to automatically and efficiently store users’ tasks persistently on their devices.</li>
                <li>Developed multiple content views to facilitate easy task organization and enhance user engagement through a clean and responsive design.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Moon Lander</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a realistic physics simulation using C++ to replicate the experience of landing on the moon, with accurate and smooth gameplay.</li>
                <li>Integrated 30 frames per second graphical rendering to visualize the lunar surface and spacecraft movements in real-time.</li>
                <li>Employed rigorous testing methodologies, including unit tests for each class, to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the simulation under various conditions.</li>
